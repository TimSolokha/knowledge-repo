It's held a consistent sales share at 78% as of Q1 2023, meaning the platform will stay here for a while. I don't exactly think Apple is evil as a company, but many things like discouraging Right-to-Repair are big turn offs for me. Having a personal ecosystem with all of your devices sounds great at first, but if you're ever on a tight budget and need to get a nice home assistant, Apple will charge you \\(200-\\)500 more than the competitor all in the name of the brand.

What was once a strong recommendation by a friend became an ecosystem that presents amazing possibilities even in 2023.</p> <p>By far my favorite part of Android is the ability to sideload apps. Having the ability to take your app off of the appstore to avoid paying Google or Apple 30% in each sale puts the power back into developer's hands. I will admit that some apps tend to skirt the law a bit, but I've mostly seen developers put out their work for all to access, regardless of location or status.</p> <p>Sure, the ecosystem isn't as succinct as Apple's, but the innovation is pouring in with RCS communication and folding phones. And while other innovations have been revealed such as Apple's Vision Pro, the Android has been constantly innovating in the space to improve the mobile experience and push it further than ever.</p>"},{"location":"android/#flavors-of-android","title":"Flavors of Android","text":"<ul> <li>Google's Stock Android</li> <li>GrapheneOS</li> <li>LineageOS</li> <li>OxygenOS</li> <li>CalyxOS</li> </ul>"},{"location":"android/#app-stores","title":"App Stores","text":"<ul> <li>Google Play Store</li> <li>F-Droid</li> </ul>"},{"location":"android/#launchers","title":"Launchers","text":"<ul> <li>Nova Launcher</li> <li>Microsoft Launcher</li> <li>Smart Launcher</li> </ul>"},{"location":"android/#features","title":"Features","text":"<ul> <li>Android smartphone can be used as a webcam Hacker News \ud83d\udcf0</li> </ul>"},{"location":"android/playstore/","title":"Google Play Store Apps","text":"<p>These apps that I interact with daily or every once in a while and can be found in the app store.
