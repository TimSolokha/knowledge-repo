## Game Development

- [aarthifical](https://www.youtube.com/@aarthificial/videos) : One of my most recent finds, aart has some great content on pixel art and the best way to use common artistic techniques with it in the game dev world. Created [Motion Canvas](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas), an open-source video editor that allows you to create animations programmatically (Typescript).

- [Acerola](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t/videos) : An early 2023 find, Acerola does amazing content over computer graphics that breaks the topic down into bite-sized chunks. One of my favorite videos is trying to recreate [CS2's Smoke](https://youtu.be/ryB8hT5TMSg), using nothing except devlogs and leaks. An absolute must watch if you want to dive into computer graphics.
