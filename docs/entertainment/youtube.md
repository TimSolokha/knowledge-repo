## Animation

- [Alan Becker](https://www.youtube.com/@alanbecker/videos) : One of the oldest animation channels around, Alan's stickman can never seem to get old. He puts them through various new situations, each building upon the last and creating a "stickman universe". Sometimes I get a nostalgia hit and look through his videos to get that sense of exploration.

## Game Development

- [aarthifical](https://www.youtube.com/@aarthificial/videos) : One of my most recent finds, aart has some great content on pixel art and the best way to use common artistic techniques with it in the game dev world. Created [Motion Canvas](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas), an open-source video editor that allows you to create animations programmatically (Typescript).

- [Acerola](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t/videos) : An early 2023 find, Acerola does amazing content over computer graphics that breaks the topic down into bite-sized chunks. One of my favorite videos is trying to recreate [CS2's Smoke](https://youtu.be/ryB8hT5TMSg), using nothing except devlogs and leaks. An absolute must watch if you want to dive into computer graphics.

But aChair reviews products from years ago and daily drives them to see if they're a right fit in our current bustling tech-filled world. If you're looking to save a few bucks or want to expand on a personal tech project, his videos have a gem or two that may fulfill your needs.
