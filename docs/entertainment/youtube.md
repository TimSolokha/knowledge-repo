## Animation

- [Alan Becker](https://www.youtube.com/@alanbecker/videos) : One of the oldest animation channels around, Alan's stickman can never seem to get old. He puts them through various new situations, each building upon the last and creating a "stickman universe". Sometimes I get a nostalgia hit and look through his videos to get that sense of exploration. 

- [Andrei Terbea](https://www.youtube.com/@andrei/videos) : Andrei can be summarized as a commentary channel assisted by animated visuals. Sure his content may not be for everyone, but it does tackle some serious topics and keeps you invested with the handwritten-like animation. A good channel to keep up to date on certain social media movements or emerging social changes.

## Game Development

- [aarthifical](https://www.youtube.com/@aarthificial/videos) : One of my most recent finds, aart has some great content on pixel art and the best way to use common artistic techniques with it in the game dev world. Created [Motion Canvas](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas), an open-source video editor that allows you to create animations programmatically (Typescript).

- [Acerola](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t/videos) : An early 2023 find, Acerola does amazing content over computer graphics that breaks the topic down into bite-sized chunks. One of my favorite videos is trying to recreate [CS2's Smoke](https://youtu.be/ryB8hT5TMSg), using nothing except devlogs and leaks. An absolute must watch if you want to dive into computer graphics.

## Tech Review

- [aChair Leg](https://www.youtube.com/@aChairLeg/videos) : Usually, tech review channels go for the best of the best. But aChair reviews products from years ago and daily drives them to see if they're a right fit in our current bustling tech-filled world. If you're looking to save a few bucks or want to expand on a personal tech project, his videos have a gem or two that may fulfill your needs. 

## Unhinged Science/Tech

- [Allen Pan](https://www.youtube.com/@allenpan/videos) : Allen Pan's ideas are some of the craziest I've seen on YouTube, but they never fail to disappoint. My favorite videos are the ones where he tries to tackle failed Kickstarter projects or childhood "dream" technology. This includes classics such as "Redeeming a Failed Kickstarter project" or "Making shoes to jump 200% higher". No matter the crazy idea or risk, Allen is there to test it and I can respect that.
