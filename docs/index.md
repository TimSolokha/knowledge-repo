# My Knowledge Wiki ðŸŒ±

This is the location for links, tools and information that I found and kept in various locations in my life. 

The format and structure is inspired by [nikiv.dev](https://wiki.nikiv.dev). Ever since I happened to stumble upon it while researching how to use a specific Jellyfin plugin, I've learned all about **digital gardens**.

My intention is that this repository is more than a place to host links that I've aggregated over the years, but a place of inspiration and insight. 

## Navigation

The main heading is structured as follows:

1. Title with a description underneath
2. Whether or not I have some say on the topic
3. Notes on the topic

The subheading is structured as follows:

1. Small description on the subtopic
2. Aggregated links over the subtopic

## My Top 5 Topics

Site is in its early stages, so no top 5 topics just yet.

## Thanks

If you happen to read this far down, thanks for taking your time to walk-through some of my content. Feel free to start your own digital garden or personal docs site with this as a template. Have a lovely day.
