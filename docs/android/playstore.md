# Google Play Store Apps

These apps that I interact with daily or every once in a while and can be found in the app store. Apps that are free are indicated with 🆓 and paid apps/apps you need money for are indicated with 💸. Apps that are critical I mark with ❤️‍🔥 and apps that I don't necessarily need are marked with 🤔.

## Social Media

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) 🆓🤔 : I mostly use twitter to follow tech news and gaming news. Though it is definitely a place where you will lose a lot of brain cells.
  
- [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/) 🆓🤔 : Reddit is a great source to find information on niche topics. Help guides are also usually amazing. However, 3rd party apps are pulled...

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/?trk=seo-authwall-base_nav-header-logo) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Living without LinkedIn is possible, but it's a good way to build a career-centered network.
  
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) 🆓🤔 : A social media that I barely check and use to catch up with friends. 

- [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) 🆓🤔 : I used to be a heavy user of DEV, but the platform has not reached a renowned usefulness. It was great in early 2017-2018, but these days it's bombarded with top 10 lists and 90% of the content is over beginner web technologies.

## Communication

- [Messages](https://messages.google.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : This default app for messaging actually isn't too bad... if you're chatting with another Android user. Talking with someone with an iPhone leads to compressed videos and pictures.
  
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A great app to communicate with friends and family. Telegram is committed to keeping its customer data away from grabby agencies, which is always nice to see.
  
- [Signal](https://signal.org/en/) 🆓🤔 : Initially installed it to chat with a friend. Not really used outside of that.
  
- [Viber](https://www.viber.com/en/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : The app isn't the best in my opinion, however, all of my relatives used it which is why it must be on my phone.
  
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A good way to build a community around a specific game/hobby. Discord themselves have been making weird decisions lately, but I'm pleased with how far its come since first using it in 2016. 
  
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) 🆓🤔 : Used for a small group of friends. Not used much outside of that (not even work lol).

## Privacy

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : One of the best password managers on the market. No need to remember all of my passwords again!
  
- [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A great tool to use to sign up with newsletters or ticketing services. 
  
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A must have on mobile. Probably the best way to browse the web (while having an adblock build-in).

## Browsers

- [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) 🆓🤔 : I mostly use bing for the Microsoft Rewards. Using ChatGPT for search is cool, but a gimmick for me at the moment.
  
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) 🆓🤔 : For a default, chrome isn't a bad browser. Brave just offers better features.
  
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) 🆓🤔 : Unlike on desktop, the mobile experience for firefox is a miss for me. It's incredibly slow at searching compared to Brave and Chrome. Hopefully the experience improves in the future. 

## Productivity

- [Google Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A place to quickly jot down notes. May or may not end up here, but is a good place for information that is needed "in the moment".
  
- [GitHub Mobile](https://github.com/mobile) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : I use this as a way to discover new open source projects. Currently one of the best ways to keep up with 
  
- [Trello](https://trello.com/home) 🆓🤔 : I used Trello heavily in school to keep track of work. These days I prefer simpler todo lists or google calendar notifications. I intend to move most of that content over here.

## Finance

- [Huntington](https://www.huntington.com/) 💸❤️‍🔥 : A banking app with a great UX experience. 
  
- [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A credit card app with polished interface. Probably the best experience for credit card payments/use on mobile.
  
- [Discover](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Not a bad experience for credit cards, but Capital One wins out with its focus on the tech experience. 
  
- [Shop](https://shop.app/) 💸❤️‍🔥 : A great way to keep track of products bought through shopify. Clean UI/UX and minimal ads :).
  
- [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/) 💸❤️‍🔥 : One of the better investment apps. Clear breakdown of investments and what's going on in the market on a given weekday. 
  
- [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/) 🆓🤔 : Simple interface, but not a great spot to keep long term investments. Only used it for promotions. 
  
- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) 🆓🤔 : Currently being sued by the SEC. Get the crypto assets out of here. 
  
- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Though the desktop experience isn't the greatest, yahoo finance on mobile is great. It breaks down tickers well and has great insight on any stock. 
  

## Music & Audio

- [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) 🆓🤔 : My first music app on Android. Ads are annoying and the algorithm for new songs isn't as good as Spotify. 
  
- [Spotifiy](https://www.spotify.com/us/free/) 🆓🤔 : Mostly used as a way to find new songs. My former music app that I use if I really have to. 
  
- [Podcast Addict](https://podcastaddict.com/) 🆓🤔 : A good podcasting app that just had too many banner ads. Can also get around the ads by paying. 

## Instant Pay

- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home) 🆓🤔 : PayPal was king for instant pay a decade ago. Nowadays it's riddled with scams and it's hard to get money back.
  
- [Venmo](https://venmo.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A great instant pay app. Used by all my friends and is convenient when you don't have cash on you.
  
- [Cash App](https://cash.app/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Not as popular in my friend group, but still a great experience. Investing in the app is an interesting choice, but I stay away from that. 

## Games

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/mobile) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Steam's app experience is now greater than it has ever been. A great way to find games and connect to your pc game library with [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353380/Steam_Link/).
  
- [Wild Rift](https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) 🆓🤔 : Played Wild Rift a lot when it first came out. Now it's dominated with microtransactions. I only play it if it's 2am, I'm in bed and I can't fall asleep.
  
- [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) 💸❤️‍🔥 : Great way to get the full terraria experience on the road. Controls are a little rough sometimes, but they get the job done. 
  
- [Super Auto Pets](https://teamwoodgames.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A great way to make time pass by if you're bored. Unique playstyles can be generated every run. 
  
- [Slay the Spire](https://www.megacrit.com/) 💸❤️‍🔥 : My favorite card game ever. A single-player dungeon crawler that I've poured hundreds of hours into. 
  
- [Dicey Dungeons](https://diceydungeons.com/) 💸❤️‍🔥 : A new game I've found recently similar to StS. The catch is that you attack with dice. Also a fun experience. 
  
- [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/player-app) 🆓🤔 : Best way to keep track of your D&D character. Only used every 2-4 months with my college friend group. 
  
- [Bloons TD 6](https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Mobile/Bloons-TD-6.html) 💸❤️‍🔥 : A legendary mobile app that can be played for hours on end. Bloon popping is just so satisfying to watch. 
  
- [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : One of the best ways to play board games on mobile. The app is just a PWA and could use some work, but the game catalog contains the best of the best. 
  
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) 💸❤️‍🔥 : The OG. Game of the decade from 2011-2021 and still going strong. Need I say more?

## Video

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Currently my most used app. Commentaries, science/tech, gaming and programming genres are my favorite. 
  
- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : The best livestreaming experience of any app. Not making the best decisions at the moment, but still has the best community and emotes. 
  
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) 💸❤️🤔 : Will be removed once password sharing is added. Catalog is getting stale and Netflix themselves are making poor decisions. 
  
- [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/) 💸❤️‍🔥 : I'm a pretty big Star Wars fan, is this is where that content lives. Everything else is hit or miss, so it may be dropped in the near future. 
  
- [Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Video/b/?&node=2858778011&ref=dvm_MLP_ROWNA_US_1) 💸❤️🤔 : I share a family account and there are only a few tv shows/movies that are worth watching. But since I don't directly pay for prime, I'll keep watching The Boys, Invincible and The Grand Tour.

## Misc

- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : On a streak of over 1000+ days learning Russian. Good for beginner sentences, but more involved learning would be better supplemented by another resource. 
  
- [Home Workout](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment&hl=en_US&gl=US) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Not the greatest workout app, but has kept me on track to staying fit and healthy.
  
- [Flipper](https://docs.flipperzero.one/mobile-app) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Got a Flipper Zero in 2022 and have loved it. This app is the easiest way to update the firmware in my opinion. 
  
- [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/mobile) 🆓🤔 : Not currently looking for a job and the job board itself is stale. Could use a front-end lift.
  
- [Kicstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/?country=US) 🆓🤔 : I used to use Kickstarter to find interesting projects. But these days the projects end up being announced on Twitter anyway. Sometimes used for scams as well.
  
- [Microsoft Lens](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&hl=en_US&gl=US) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A great way to scan documents if you don't have one included with your printer.
