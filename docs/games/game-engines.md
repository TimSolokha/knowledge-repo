# Game Engines & Libraries

Playing games has always been a favorite of mine, but I didn't start wanting to create them until I reached college. In university, I built an AI guidance game in Unity and a 3rd person nautical game in Unreal Engine. My game dev journey really started to click when I created game jams in Godot, which is the engine I've stuck with to this day.
