# Board Games

As most people have probably experienced in their childhood, popular board games were played often at my friend's and family homes. What I wish I got into sooner, however, are the good board game publishers. Sure I played UNO, Monopoly, Jenga, but the real gems were introduced to me by my uncle, who's been collecting board games for more than a decade with tons of gems.
