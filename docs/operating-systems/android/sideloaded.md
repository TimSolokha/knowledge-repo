# Side Loaded Apps

- [Infinity (Reddit 3rd Party)](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit) 🆓❤️‍🔥 :

- [Harmonic](https://github.com/SimonHalvdansson/Harmonic-HN) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A great client to browse HackerNews on mobile.

- [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : An android terminal emulator that allows you to work on code, ssh into other machines and get linux packages as well. 

- [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A tower-defense game made by a good friend of mine with the code being open source. If games like factorio or shapez.io intrigue you, this game would be right up that alley. 

- [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : The full Youtube experience on mobile without ads or having to sign in. UI is a bit outdated, but that is being actively discussed. Great for downloading Youtube videos and/or songs. 

- [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A great app for hardcore manga readers. Not my personal option at the moment, but always a good recommendation. 

- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : With Plex's shift to becoming more of a streaming service, Jellyfin steps up and attempts to fill its footsteps. Things like `Skip Intro` and downloaded media aren't available natively just yet, but are actively being worked on. Favorite service to host media as of 2023.

- [ViMusic](https://github.com/vfsfitvnm/ViMusic) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : This app scrapes Youtube for music. Only downside at the moment is not being to able to cache your last played song (probably has some relation to needing an account to sync).

- [Seal](https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : A great Youtube downloader (Audio and Video). Uses Material You, but doesn't play YouTube content in the app. 

- [Ivy Wallet](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet) 🆓🤔 : A budgeting app that looks stunning. My personal budgeting tool has moved over to a spreadsheet, but this app is great for people getting started with managing their finances. 

- [Localsend](https://localsend.org/#/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : The best way to send files over your network to another computer. Has support for both desktop and mobile, and download speeds are double or triple if you were to do this through Android Share or AirDrop instead. 

- [Destiny Item Manager](https://destinyitemmanager.com/) 🆓🤔 : If you play Destiny 2 and need to manage your items from any device, this is the app for you. Support on desktop and mobile, and the only reason I don't use it is because I'm taking a well needed break from Destiny :).

- [Revanced Manager](https://revanced.app/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : The best YouTube premium experience without having to pay for it. It offers everything that NewPipe does, but with a better UI/UX experience. Does need to have an account signed in.

- [Harmonoid](https://harmonoid.com/) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Similar to **ViMusic** above, this app allows you to stream music from Youtube Music. Currently has better UI/UX (Material Design) than ViMusic and is my go-to music app. 

- [Saikou](https://github.com/saikou-app/saikou) 🆓❤️‍🔥 : Hands down the BEST app to stream anime and manga. A downloading option currently isn't available, but the experience for on-demand content is the best I have seen yet. Also has integration with AniList and has a calendar for upcoming shows.
